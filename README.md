# Java Multithreading Snippets 🚀

This repository contains multiple Java examples demonstrating **multithreading and concurrency concepts**.  
It covers both **basic** and **advanced** topics like thread creation, synchronization, deadlocks, daemon threads, `ExecutorService`, and more.

---

## 📌 Concepts Covered
- ✅ Creating Threads (`Thread` class & `Runnable`)
- ✅ Thread Lifecycle (`start()`, `run()`, `join()`)
- ✅ Synchronization with `synchronized` keyword
- ✅ Using **Locks** (`ReentrantLock`, `ReadWriteLock`)
- ✅ Handling **Deadlocks**
- ✅ **Daemon Threads**
- ✅ **ThreadGroup**
- ✅ **Executor Framework** (`ExecutorService`, `ThreadPoolExecutor`, `Callable`, `Future`)
- ✅ Concurrency Utilities (`CountDownLatch`, `CyclicBarrier`, etc.) *(if you included them)*
